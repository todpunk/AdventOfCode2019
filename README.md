My fiddlings for Advent of Code 2019

I usually stop after about a week and I lose the time vs interest war.

This year I'm applying some of my Go tinkerings.  Yes, I know it's not great.  Yes, that's because I'm a go n00b.

I may refactor it later, but that's more likely to happen if you create an issue telling me how I should.  =c)
